# superpixel-image-segmentation

This repository builds a segmentation network, which uses SLIC Superpixels as input. In essense, it will be a classifier for superpixels. The end product is a system which, when given an image, computes superpixels and classifies each superpixel as one of the 9 classes of MSRC v1.
